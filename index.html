                Akatsuki is a secret organization created by Uchiha Madara in order to destroy The hidden leaf village. Thus, Uchiha Madara, when created this organization, he planned on destroying the hidden leaf village because of a lot of things that came off between the Uchiha clan and the Hidden leaf village a long time ago. This made him get consumed with hatred. However, Madara knew that he couldn't put his plans and goals in action just by himself, so he would need new members with special, higher-level powers so that he could carry the beginning of his plans out. Some time later, Pain joins the Akatsuki along with Konan and Uchiha Madara notice that both of them are still kids, yet with special, powerful and strong abilities.

                <h3>the Village Hidden in the Rain</h3>
                <p>
                    Nagato (known better as Pain) was the recognized leader of Akatsuki and a God of Amegakure. Reffered to as Leader by all akatsuki members, except for Konan, he always directed the actions of the rest of the group and maintained authority over them. However, he had secretly collaborated with Uchiha Madara. According to Madara, Nagato is a descendant of the Uzumaki clan. During the Second Great Shinobi World War, Nagato lived with his parents in a village near Amegakure. One day two Konoha shinobis broke into their home looking for food, unaware that the place was still inhabited. Nagato's parents, believing they were going to killed, attacked the two so that Nagato could scape. Having mistaken them to be enemy ninjas, the konoha ninjas killed his parents. In his grief, Nagato awakened his Rinnegan and killed the assailants. He would come to consider this the First Great Pain Of His Life.  </p>

                <p>
                    Hidan belonged to Yugakure, also known as the Village Hidden in Hot Water, and was an S-rank shinobi. Unfortunately, very little is known about his childhood as his past is still shrouded in mystery. Hidan grew enraged with how things were progressing after Yugakure turned from a shinobi village to a tourist destination. Before fleeing Yugakure and joining the cult-like Jashin religion, he killed his neighbors because he believed the shinobi who lived there were meant to be killed. The way of Jashin worships a deity named Lord Jashin and its core principle central tenet appears to be a blatant slaughter, with anything short of complete annihilation being condemned as sin. Hidan was granted immortality after testing Jashin's undiscovered method. After joining the Jashinists, he started believing that anyone who does not worship Jashin is meant to be killed.

                    Kakuzu belonged to Takigakure, also known as the Village Hidden in the Waterfall, and was an S-rank shinobi. Unfortunately, very little is known about his childhood and past as his heritage is still shrouded in mystery. Because of his formidable abilities, the higher-ups of Takigakure assigned him a mission to assassinate The First Hokage of Konoha, Hashirama Senju, who is renowned as the God of Shinobi. Although he was one of the strongest shinobi of his time, he was still no match for Hashirama Senju. Despite the fact that he laid his life on the line for his village and faced overwhelming danger, he was severely punished for failing in his mission. Kakuzu developed a fierce hatred for Takigakure as he escaped from prison as a result of this treatment. Kakuzu killed the village elders, stole their hearts, and left with the knowledge of the most valuable kinjutsu (forbidden jutsu) in the village, known as Earth Grudge Fear. He earned a living as a rogue ninja by engaging in black market bounty hunting and ripping out the still-beating hearts of formidable shinobi in order to lengthen his own lifespan and prowess.

Black Zetsu was the only person in the Naruto world with the remarkable talent known as Body Coating Technique. He could use the plasticity of his own body to cover the target with this technique. He was able to use all of the methods and Kekkei Genkai that the target had by using Body Coating. He employed Rinne Rebirth Jutsu to revive Madara by performing this technique on Obito Uchiha.
